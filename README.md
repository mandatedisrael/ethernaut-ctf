**Solution**

To solve the "Hello Ethernaut" challenge, read carefully the `abi` of the `HelloEthernaut` contract and call the `password` function, this will return the password which is used as the parameter for calling the `authenticate` function and this unlocks the level.


- Smart Contract: `contract/HelloEthernaut.sol`
