### **Solution**üèÜ

To solve the "Hello Ethernaut" challenge, read carefully the `abi` of the `HelloEthernaut` contract and call the `password` function, this will return the password which is used as the parameter for calling the `authenticate` function and this unlocks the level.


- Smart Contract: `contract/HelloEthernaut.sol`

### Task üßµ
- Claim ownership of the contract
- Withdraw the contract's funds

### **Solution**üèÜ

To solve the "Fallback" challenge, You need to understand the how `receive` and `fallback` function works in Solidity

- When msg.data is empty, the `receive` function is called.
- When msg.data is not empty, the `fallback` function is called.

To solve this challenge, you need to send a transaction to the contract with some data, this will call the `receive` function and ownership will be transfered to you which is the first objective.
Lastly, since you are the owner of the contract, you have the access to call the `withdraw` function to drain out the wallet and this will unlock the level.


- Smart Contract: `contract/Fallout.sol`
